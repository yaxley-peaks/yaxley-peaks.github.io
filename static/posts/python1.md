# Python walrus operator is so annoying

I get that it's not meant to be used for funny golfing reasons but please why won't it work when it seems like it should. I have spent many many hours breaking my head over this.

The [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/) says that things like:
```py
a = b := c
```
are not allowed because uh uh uh _readability_.

IMO, consistency is way more important than **readability** because that feels so much more, well, consistent. ~~lol~~

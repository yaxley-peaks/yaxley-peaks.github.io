# Funny smell
This bottle of isopropyl alcohol I have which [they](https://www.scientificbazaar.com/scientific-lab-instruments/retrend-medicare-8100.php) brand
> `isorub`

smells really funny.

Like it does smell like how rubbing alcohol smells (which I really like) but then it also has a strange musty after-odor. Almost earthy. IDK whats wrong with it but it burns like how it should so I assume theres nothing wrong with it.
